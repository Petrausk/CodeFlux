The file is part of version 4.3.1 of the software and is generally considered safe, provided it is downloaded from the official Tweak Now website or a reputable source. However, like any executable file, it can be flagged by some antivirus programs due to its nature, and users may encounter errors if the software is not properly installed or if there are compatibility issues with their system. It's essential to ensure that the file is not a variant of malware or a virus masquerading under the same name, as such threats can sometimes exploit legitimate software names. Users are advised to run regular scans with updated antivirus software and be cautious of any unexpected behavior from their system after installation.
